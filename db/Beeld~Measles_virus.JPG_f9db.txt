   Description
   English: This thin-section transmission electron micrograph (TEM)
   revealed the ultrastructural appearance of a single virus particle, or
   “virion”, of measles virus. The measles virus is a paramyxovirus, of
   the genus Morbillivirus. It is 100-200 nm in diameter, with a core of
   single-stranded RNA, and is closely related to the rinderpest and
   canine distemper viruses. Two membrane envelope proteins are important
   in pathogenesis. They are the F (fusion) protein, which is responsible
   for fusion of virus and host cell membranes, viral penetration, and
   hemolysis, and the H (hemagglutinin) protein, which is responsible for
   adsorption of virus to cells.

   There is only one antigenic type of measles virus. Although studies
   have documented changes in the H glycoprotein, these changes do not
   appear to be epidemiologically important (i.e., no change in vaccine
   efficacy has been observed).

   Prior to 1963, almost everyone got measles; it was an expected life
   event. Each year in the U.S. there were approximately 3 to 4 million
   cases and an average of 450 deaths, with epidemic cycles every 2 to 3
   years. More than half the population had measles by the time they were
   6 years old, and 90 % had the disease by the time they were 15. This
   indicates that many more cases were occurring than were being reported.
   However, after the vaccine became available, the number of measles
   cases dropped by 98 % and the epidemic cycles drastically diminished.
   Measles virus is rapidly inactivated by heat, light, acidic pH, ether,
   and trypsin. It has a short survival time (<2 hours) in the air, or on
   objects and surfaces.
